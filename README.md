# Variant Impact Reporting Ontology (VIRO)
The Variant Impact Reporting Ontology (VIRO) is an application ontology for describing pathogen mutations, their functional effects, and links to literature evidence. This is a slice of [GenEpiO](https://github.com/GenEpiO/genepio).

The associated data specification can be found at [https://github.com/cidgoh/pathogen-mutation-functionalannotation-package](https://github.com/cidgoh/pathogen-mutation-functionalannotation-package).

For more information about VIRO, please see my thesis: [An ontology-based approach for modelling viral variant functional effects](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0450035).
